					Chicken
				</span>
				<span class="content">
					Chicken is indeed a very good option for a menu. However, it lacks something special. It lacks the ability
					to wow a consumer. How many times have we had chicken in our lives? It is the most generic of meats and many other meats taste just like it.
					Chicken is a classic, but it is also a safety.

				<span class="title2">
					Beef
				</span>
				<span class="content">
					Beef is a very versatile meat with many different cuts, styles, and preperations that chefs can use while cooking it. Beef can be used to create steak, a juicy, succulent, pan fried treat, but also be used to cook barbeque ribs, a sweet, smoky sensation of a taste.

				<span class="title3">
					Sushi
				</span>
				<span class="content">
					Another very versatile option, maybe even more so than beef, Sushi is a very polarizing meat, if one can even call it a meat. It is loved by many, but also disliked by many simply for the fact that many are turned off of its rawness for fear of any adverse health-related side effects.
